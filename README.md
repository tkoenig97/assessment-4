## Running Tests

To run tests, first ensure you install `vitest` and `TestRenderer` into your project.

```bash
  npm install vitest
  npm install react-test-renderer
```

Now in your `package.json`  add the following key to your scripts
```json
 "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    // Here we are adding the test command to run with npm
    "test": "vitest"
  },
```

Now ensure the `__tests__` folder is inside your `src` folder in your project, then go through each testing file and ensure the functions and imports correlate with your project.


Finally run the test suite with the following command
```bash
  npm test
```
